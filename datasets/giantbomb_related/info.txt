- Giantbomb organizes a list of characters, concepts, places, and object names for a specific game

query_giantbomb_api.py -> uses API to return 
giantbomb_games.json -> sample of detailed information of searching for a specific game on giantbomb API, in this case "Team Fortress Classic". 
                        Only relevant new information I could find was field "deck", but i'm not sure if we want it?
