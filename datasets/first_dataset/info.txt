Dataset obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset?select=games.csv

# Content: 
Contained basic info of steam games up to 2024
Data obtained from steam API, so it is legal
Also some data from steamspy about estimated sales


# Steps:
process_dataset.py Filtered some game names that weren't western or appropriate, and only included relevant fields and entries
                      Only included games from 2013-2022 (10 year range, and last year has a bit of space from 2024, to allow for more data produced on those games)
                      Only included games with estimated sales >= 100.000
                      
 -> "obtained parsed_games.json"
