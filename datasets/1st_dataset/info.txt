# Steps:
process_dataset.py Filtered some game names that weren't western or appropriate, and only included relevant fields
                      Only included games from 2013-2022 (10 year range, and last year has a bit of space from 2024, to allow for more data produced on those games)
                      Only included games with estimated sales >= 100.000
                      
 -> "obtained parsed_games.json"
