Disregard this folder for now, it was just a test of giantBomb's api.
- What i wanted in specific from this API was the fact that they organize a list of characters, concepts, places, and object names for a specific game, which i think would be very cool to add in our search engine
- Struggled to achieve what i wanted tho..

giantbomb_games.json -> sample of detailed information of searching for a specific game on giantbomb API, in this case "Team Fortress Classic". 
                        Only relevant new information I could find was field "deck", but i'm not sure if we want it?

giantbomb_games_with_entity_names.json -> attempt at extracting the list of characters, concepts, places, and object names for a specific game. Couldn't understand how the API works.
                                          I tried querying characters by the specific gameID i got from "giantbomb_games.json", but it wasn't working?? Always returns the same 100 random unrelated games characters...

Currently, the query_giantbomb_api.py is not producing the correct results, ignore it.

NOTE: Also giantbomb API, has a a low rate limit of requests, so:
- we should consider if we even want this data, or can obtain it elsewhere
- If we do want to use it, we should be sure on which small subset of games we want to query from the API first, before actually doing it
