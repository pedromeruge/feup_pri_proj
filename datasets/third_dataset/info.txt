Dataset obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joyshil0599/multi-decade-video-game-review-dataset -> video_game_review.csv
Upon inspecting the provided dataset, it only contained links to reviews, which can not be directly scraped in legal ways to obtain its contents, so i don't think we should use it (to obtain the reviews text at least, the rest of the values we might use)

Instead, i'm using gamespot API directly to fetch reviews for the games that remain in the "datasets/2nd_dataset/merged_games.json"

# Contents:
    Gamespot staff and user ratings with extensive texts
    Source of data is directly an API, so legal

# Steps:
query_gamespot_api.py : Currently, fetching the game reviews from the API, but it's going to take a few hours, since there's an hourly limit. This is why i didn't push it. When it's finished i'll push it
