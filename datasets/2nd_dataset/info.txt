Dataset obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/games-on-steam/data -> games_info/games_info.json

# Contents:
    Steam game ratings from different plataforms
    Source of data isn't mentioned, but can be obtained through APIs (although difficult because free plans are very limited) - so it's legal

# Steps:
process_dataset.py : Filtered some game names that weren't western or appropriate, and only included relevant fields -> obtained "parsed_games_info.json"
filter_relevant_games.py : From "parsed_games_info.json", reduced dataset size by only including games that had igdb_popularity >= 1.01, so around 5000 games remain -> obtained "filtered_games_info.json"
merge_filtered_games_with_1st_dataset.py: Merged the just mentioned json (aka "datasets/2nd_dataset/filtered_games_info.json") with the 1st_dataset parsed json (datasets/1st_dataset/parsed_games.json"), to obtain one coherent dataset with all the data -> obtained "merged_games.json"
